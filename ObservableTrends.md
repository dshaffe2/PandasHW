# While more Males make purchases and play games, Females are actually more likely to make a 2nd purchase as the average purchases per Female are 1.39 as opposed to 1.34 for Males
# In addition to being more likely to make a 2nd purchase, Females also spend more per purchase than men do by 40 cents
# I am old and will soon be approaching the age bin that has the least percentage of players :-(
